                    <p> If you're reading this, I'm assuming you know how to clean your house. And not just clean your house, but clean it extremely well. (If not, check out the <a href="resources.html" target="_blank">Resources</a> page for some life-changing books on keeping house!) I'm assuming you know at the very least to throw your smelly gym bag far away from where guests will be, and early enough in the day so that the scent of your stinky shoes doesn't linger in the hallway. That's all well and good when it's just you, but not when you're having company over.</p>
                    <p> So, how do you decorate well? Well, much like the rest of the topics on Brunchwell, it can be as simple or as complicated as your budget and space allows. A light scent in the foyer when guests arrive is always a plus. Fresh cut flowers bring a welcoming energy to your home. Open the windows, if the air quality and season permits. Besides that, you can go for plastic-ware or a 12 piece table setting fit for royalty, if your theme calls for it. I find that using sites like <a href="https://www.pinterest.com" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en" target="_blank">Instagram</a> helps me gather ideas for any project or event I'm working on. Decorating books, advertisements, and even color swatches can inspire great decor ideas.</p>

                <section class="protip"><span class="hashtag">#ProTip:</span> Keep a budget. I'm serious. MAKE AND KEEP YOUR BUDGET. Be realistic, and within your means. This is brunch, an acceptably low-key meal designed for shameless day drinkers, people who like to sleep in late, and folks with commitment issues fluidly maneuvering around the hard lines between breakfast and lunch. If Abstact Expressionism were a meal, it would be a 2PM brunch. Anyways, I personally think it's better to spend more towards food than on decor.
